                        I am a student who is interested in programming, game development, and music creation. I have been programming for a few years now, and I have created a variety of projects in different languages and platforms.

                        I have experience with languages such as Python, JavaScript, GDScript, and java. I have also worked with game engines like LibGDX and Godot. My projects range from simple scripts and other works to more complex games and applications.
